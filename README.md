**👥 HR Data Analytics: Workforce & Attrition Intelligence**
**📌 Project Overview**
This project delivers a deep-dive analysis of organizational human resources data. By transforming raw employee records into an interactive **Power BI dashboard**, this study provides HR leadership with the tools to monitor **workforce stability**, track **diversity goals**, and identify **attrition triggers** before they impact the bottom line.

**🛠️ Technical Toolbelt**
**Analytics Tool: Power BI Desktop**

**Data Engineering:** **Power Query** (ETL processes for handling sensitive employee data, cleaning nulls, and normalizing departmental hierarchies).

**Advanced Analytics (DAX):** Created specialized measures for **Attrition Rate %**, **Headcount Velocity**, and **Performance-to-Salary Ratios**.

**Data Modeling:** Optimized **Star Schema** architecture for high-speed reporting across multiple dimensions.

**🔍 Key Features & Insights**
**Executive Summary:** Instant visibility into **Total Headcount**, **Active vs. Inactive Staff**, and the **Organizational Attrition Rate**.

**Demographics & Diversity:** Granular breakdown of the workforce by **Age**, **Gender**, and **Ethnicity** to monitor and meet corporate D&I benchmarks.

**Attrition Deep-Dive:** Multi-dimensional analysis of exits segmented by Department, Job Role, and Tenure to pinpoint "high-risk" areas.

**Performance vs. Compensation:** Correlation analysis identifying if **Performance Ratings** are aligned with **Salary Packages** to ensure fair pay and talent retention.

**Departmental Health:** Heatmaps identifying which departments face the highest turnover and need immediate recruitment support.

**📈 Data Architecture**
The project utilizes a **Star Schema** to ensure maximum performance and filter responsiveness:

**Fact Table:** Centralized employee records (Salary, Tenure, Performance Ratings).

**Dimension Tables:** Dedicated tables for **Calendar (Date)**, **Departmental Metadata**, **Job Roles**, and **Geographic Locations**.

**💡 Strategic Business Insights**
**Retention Alert:** Identified that the **Sales Department** experiences a 15% higher attrition rate among employees with less than 2 years of tenure.

**Pay Equity:** Discovered a 10% gap in performance-to-pay alignment in middle-management roles, suggesting a need for salary benchmarking.

**Diversity Pulse:** Data-backed evidence showing a steady 5% increase in workforce diversity over the last three fiscal quarters.
